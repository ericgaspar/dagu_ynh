Dagu is a powerful Cron alternative that comes with a Web UI. It allows you to define dependencies between commands as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in a declarative YAML format. Dagu simplifies the management and execution of complex workflows. It natively supports running Docker containers, making HTTP requests, and executing commands over SSH.
